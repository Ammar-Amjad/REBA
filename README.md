# REBA
Real-Time Electric Bill Analysis 

Electiricty is a valued resourcse especially in Pakistan.
Keeping track of electric consumption can lead to alot of monetary savings as well as helps save energy.
REBA uses Machine Learning to caluclate your electronic device's consumption and generates the current cost of each active device.

PROCEDURE:
Making dataset from Current Transformer.
C.T passes data to PC through a node mcu attached to an audiono.

The dataset includes current, voltage and power along with timestamps.

Using sklearn, the best accuracy acheived is about 70% but with significant overfitting.

REBA is currently under development!!!
